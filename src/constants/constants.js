      "This is a full-stack chat app that I developed in order to learn Socket.IO. Users are able to communicate in real-time in any of the site's channels, as well as create their own channels for particular topics. I built the server with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for permanent data storage and Socket.IO to create event-based communication between the front and backend of the app.",

      "As part of my education, I had the opportunity to work with the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (or C4ADS) to develop their Sanctions Explorer application. The focus of this project was to help consolidate and track sanctions data from a number of different authorities and present it to the user in a digestible way. I collaborated with a cross-functional team that included web developers, data scientists, and a UX designer, to both refactor existing code, and implement new features.",
